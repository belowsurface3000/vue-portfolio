# Vue.js first try | Portfolio page

## Info
After one year of React development this project was my first try with Vue.js. The goal was convert my portfolio page from React to Vue and implementing functionalities like global state management, email sending and smooth scrolling to anchors within the main page.
To get the contact form working, emailjs credentials are needed in an .env.local file under this variable names:

VUE_APP_EMAIL_SERVICE=
VUE_APP_EMAIL_TEMPLATE=
VUE_APP_EMAIL_USER=

Two pages are missing in the public repo /src/views/ for privacy reasons:
- DatenschutzPage.vue
- ImpressumPage.vue

## How to develop
- clone the repo
- $ npm i
- $ npm run serve
